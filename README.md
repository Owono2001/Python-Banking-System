## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **🐍 Python:** The backbone of this application, providing a versatile and readable language.
* **📦 Standard Library:** Leveraging Python's built-in modules for efficient file handling and other essential operations.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows a modular design, making it easy to understand and maintain:

* **🧩 Functions:** Encapsulating specific tasks into reusable blocks of code.
* **<0xF0><0x9F><0x97><0x8B>️ Lists:** Efficiently managing collections of data like customer accounts and transactions.
* **📄 File Handling:** Reading and writing data to text files for persistent storage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository)*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

3.  **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py  # Or the name of your main script
    ```

    Follow the prompts on your screen to interact with the system as either an administrator or a customer.
