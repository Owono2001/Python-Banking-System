For the Introduction to Programming in Python assignment, I developed a comprehensive Banking Service System application. The objective was to create a program that manages customer accounts, allowing both customers and admin staff to interact with the system through a menu-driven interface.

Key features include:

A login page for both admin staff and customers, where customers can perform transactions such as deposits and withdrawals.
Admins can register new customers, create accounts, and update customer details (excluding ID and name).
The system automatically generates unique account numbers and supports both savings and current accounts, each with a minimum balance requirement (RM100 for savings and RM500 for current).
Customers can view their account statements for a specified period, with the total of deposits and withdrawals displayed.
All data is stored in text files, and the system includes thorough validations to ensure error-free operations.
The project required modular programming techniques, utilizing lists, functions, and file handling in Python. The solution was implemented following good programming practices, with proper comments, variable naming conventions, and indentation.
